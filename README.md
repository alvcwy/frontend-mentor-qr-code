## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

As someone with little experience on the frontend, this was a great starter project to work on my CSS. My main takeaways are:
- Creating a box with CSS (resize a div and give it a background color)
- Adapting CSS properties to work on both mobile and desktop
- Using Google Fonts instead of default HTML fonts

### Continued development

I will probably continue with other Frontend Mentor challenges and see how it goes from there. Thanks for checking this out!
